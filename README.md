### Description

This code is able to inject any DLL into a remote process, or even itself. This should be used only if you know what your doing. It was ported from a C++ application which i edited, i believe it was Felix's from http://win32.mvps.org/. Anyway, this code is a bit old as it is, there are probably some examples around anyway. Please vote =]
